# Rationale

This project focused on the development of a functional web application utilising dynamic data retrieved through one or more APIs, following a brief for this project/ The design of this functional web application will be based on the prototype completed in Project 1.

The brief for this project states that the development of this project work will be undertaken with the National Film and Sound Archive, more specifically, this project will utilise the NFSA’s Search the Collection API. Throughout this project, the functional web application will be developed to allow users to search through many of the ‘Home Movies’, which are short amateur films or videos, typically created for the purpose of preserving personal moments for the filmer (Wikiwand, 2024), that have been published within the NFSA. Additionally, this project will be developed utilising a prototype that was also developed following this brief, created in Project 1.

Throughout the development of this functional web application, the needs of the briefing must be fulfilled, whilst balancing the requirements of the design and technical implications. Skills will be bought from previous units, including the units Programming for Design, and Front-End Web Design, which will ensure that this web application uses semantic HTML and CSS to make this application responsive.

The development of this project began with the installation and setup of Vue, which has been used through this project for the development of this functional web application. Vue is a JavaScript framework for building user interfaces (Vue.js, 2024). Vue builds upon standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing a declarative, component-based programming model that assists developers develop user interfaces of any complexity. However, due to the fact that this was my first experience with utilising Vue for development, I had no previous experience, and had to set up Vue on my own device to successfully develop this project. This was successfully completed using Visual Studio Code, which was additionally heavily utilised throughout the development of this project, along with Vue’s own site.

After successfully installing and setting-up Vue on my own device, I had a basic Vue site set up that I was able to make changes to. From this basic site, I did begin editing this application to successfully transition to the functional web application I had planned within the previous project’s prototype.

However, there were several issues that were encountered within the development of this project. The main issue found throughout the development was my own limited knowledge of Vue, and I was therefore required to research Vue to discover how to successfully transition Vue’s site into the functional web application required. Many of the resources found in this research either did not fit this project, or simply did not work for this project. The main way research was able to be completed to make updates to this project was within university tutorials, including speaking to other students and the tutor within these tutorials.

Following all of this, I do believe throughout this project I was able to successfully create a functional web application that utilises the NFSA’s Search the Collection API. This application allows users to search through many of the ‘Home Movies’ that have been published within the NFSA.

However, due to the limitations throughout the development of this project, the finalised web application does not match the prototype that was developed in Project 1. Several changes to the overall design and functionality had to be made to this application to match my own abilities and capabilities of the design that I am personally able to complete utilising Vue.

It is clear though that throughout the development of this project, I have successfully learnt new skills utilising both Vue and developing user interfaces in general, along with the abilities to create a functional web application using these skills.
